# Anime_World 
This is the second project that I built by applying and enhancing what I have previously learned about HTML and CSS from the WEB 1400 class at Dixie State University. I created an e-commerce website that sell action figures of famous Anime series, because I wanted to create something that I was really interested in.
 
Overall, the website was very basic, but I definitely have learned a lot about JavaScript while building it, especially when I needed to write functions for the shop page, allowing the users to select their desired items, add them to the cart, and place an order. For this project, I learned how to use Stripe for the checkout process. I felt that it would be beneficial to learn such a great tool. 

On top of that, I learned Node.js in order to create and run a server for this website. I also worked a lot more with the database, from getting the items in the inventory from a json file to saving the customer's purchase information to another database. 

For me, this project was an important milestone in the journey of learning how to become a better Web Developer. It was also the beginning of many projects that came after. 

This is the link to the web app. Please feel free to check it out and give me feedbacks, thank you!
